## Webhooks

Smile uses webhooks to notify your application in real time when an event happens in your environment.

These are sent via a secure channel, using HTTPS from a static IP address, with the data being sent in JSON format. These also come with a signature for you to validate the authenticity of the payload. 

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> Our static IP address is **18.142.61.230**. You can whitelist this IP address in your back-end to ensure that your application receives event notifications coming from Smile.

Webhooks are particularly useful for getting notifications about asynchronous events, and either executing actions in your backend system when any of these events happen, or knowing when to refresh your front-end system to display any new data.

Event notifications can be sent when a new user is created, an account is successfully connected, an employment document is uploaded, an invitation is sent, or when new any new type data is added such as a user's identity, income, employment, and others. Check out the list of available events that you can subscribe to in *List of Events*, below. 


### Implementation Steps

You can start receiving event notifications in your application using the following steps:

1. Use our documentation and available resources to **identify the events you want to monitor** and the event payloads to parse.
2. **Create a webhook endpoint** as an HTTPS endpoint (URL) on your  server or application. 
3. **Test that your webhook endpoint is working properly.** Make sure that your server or application is able to handle requests from Smile by parsing each event object and returning ``2xx`` response status codes.
4. **Deploy your webhook endpoint** so itâ€™s a publicly accessible HTTPS URL.
5. **Register your publicly accessible webhook endpoint** by making a request to the ``/webhooks`` endpoint. You will need to specify the following:
   - **URL**: the webhook endpoint or URL.
   - **Event types**: the event types you want to monitor, separated by commas (see below for the different event types), or simply use ``ALL_EVENTS`` to get notifications on all event types.
   - **Active**: whether you want this endpoint definition to be active or inactive (you can update this later via an update request)
   - **Secret**: a phrase or value that you can use to validate the authenticity of the payload by digesting the received payload body using HMAC-SHA512, with the secret as the key. See *Validating Payloads*, below.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> Below example shows a request using Shell script/cURL with the webhook receiving endpoint set as ``https://webhook.clienturl.xyz``
> 
> ``` curl
> curl --request POST \
>   --url https://sandbox.smileapi.io/v1/webhooks \
>   --header 'Authorization: Basic amFuLnBhYmVsbG9uQHNtaWxlZmluYW5jaWFsLmFwcDpOZXRTdWl0ZTIwMTgh' \
>   --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
>   --data '{
>   "name": "Event Notification Postback",
>   "url": "https://webhook.clienturl.xyz",
>   "eventTypes": [
>     "ACCOUNT_CONNECTED",
>     "IDENTITY_ADDED"
>   ],
>   "active": true,
>   "secret": "a little secret"
> }'
> ```

### Webhook Retries

To ensure you receive the notification, Smile will check for a HTTP response with status code between 200 and 299 from your endpoint when we send the webhook.

In the event that we receive a response not between 200 and 299, Smile will attempt to resend the webhook up to two times with a couple of seconds between each retry.

Please ensure you process these possible duplicate notifications in your endpoint or application.

## Validating Payloads

When events are sent from Smile, you might want to validate the authenticity of the webhook payload, to make sure it came from Smile. You can do that by using the signature, which is included in the headers of each payload. 

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> To validate the authenticity of the payload, you need to get the entirety of the payload body and digest it using HMAC-SHA512, with the "secret" you defined when you registered your endpoint as the key.

Below is example to check the validity of a payload using HMAC-SHA512:

- NodeJs
    ``` javascript
    const http = require('http');
    const crypto = require('crypto');
    const serverPort = 80
    const requestListener = function (req, res) {
      // the client secret is being configured when a webhook is created
      const client_secret = 'a little secret';
      var requestBody = '';
      req.on('readable', () => {
        var read = req.read()
        if(read != null) {
        requestBody += read;
        }
      });
      req.on('end', () => {
        jsonBody = JSON.stringify(requestBody);
        // do whatever you need with jsonBody, however use requestBody in the signature payload
        signature = crypto.createHmac('sha512',client_secret).update(requestBody).digest('hex');
      console.log('Signature:' + signature);
      res.writeHead(200);
      res.end(signature);
      })
    }
    const server = http.createServer(requestListener);
    server.listen(serverPort);
    ```
- JAVA
    ``` Java
    package com.smile.webhook;
    
    import java.io.BufferedReader;
    import java.io.IOException;
    import java.util.Objects;
    import javax.crypto.Mac;
    import javax.crypto.SecretKey;
    import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;
    import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
    import org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Hex;
    
    public class VerifySignatureUtil {
    
        public static boolean verifySignature(HttpServletRequest request) throws IOException {
            String data = getRequestBody(request);
            String secret = "<your secret>";
            String signature = request.getHeader("Smile-Signature");
            boolean result = Objects.equals(signature, generateSignature(secret, data));
            System.out.println("verify result:" + result);
            return result;
        }
    
        private static String getRequestBody(HttpServletRequest request) throws IOException {
            if (request.getMethod().equals("POST")) {
                StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    
                try (BufferedReader bufferedReader = request.getReader()) {
                    char[] charBuffer = new char[128];
                    int bytesRead;
                    while ((bytesRead = bufferedReader.read(charBuffer)) != -1) {
                        sb.append(charBuffer, 0, bytesRead);
                    }
                }
    
                return sb.toString();
            }
            return "";
        }
    
        private static String generateSignature(String secret, String requestBody) {
            byte[] key= secret.getBytes();
            byte[] content= requestBody.getBytes();
            String signature = null;
            try {
                SecretKey secretKey = new SecretKeySpec(key, "HmacSHA512");
                Mac mac = Mac.getInstance("HmacSHA512");
                mac.init(secretKey);
                byte[] bytes = mac.doFinal(content);
                signature = Hex.encodeHexString(bytes);
            } catch (Exception var6) {
                throw new RuntimeException(var6);
            }
            System.out.println("signature=" + signature);
            return signature;
        }
    
    }
    ```

If your digest matches the one that you received as the payload signature in the headers, then the payload is valid and authentic.

> ðŸš§ Warning
> 
> When you validate the payload, make sure you digest the entire payload. Do not include extra spaces before or after it. Do not pre-parse or reformat it before doing the validation check.
