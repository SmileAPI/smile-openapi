## Webhooks


Smile uses webhooks to notify your application in real time when an event happens in your environment. These are sent via a secure channel, using HTTPS with the data being sent in JSON format. These are sent via a static IP address, and also come with a signature for you to validate the authenticy of the payload. 

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> Our static IP address is **18.142.61.230**. You can whitelist this IP address in your back-end to ensure that your application receives event notifications coming from Smile.

Webhooks are particularly useful for getting notifications on asynchronous events, executing actions in your backend system when any of these events happen, or knowing when to refresh your front-end system to display any new data. Event notifications can be sent when a new user is created, an account is successfully connected, an employment document is uploaded, an invitation is sent, or when new any new type data is added such as a user's identity, income, employment, document, ratings, transaction, or contribution.


**Implementation Steps**

You can start receiving event notifications in your application using the following steps:

1. Use our documentation and available resources to identify the events you want to monitor and the event payloads to parse.
2. Create a webhook endpoint as an HTTPS endpoint (URL) on your  server or application. 
3. Test that your webhook endpoint is working properly. Make sure that your server or application is able to handle requests from Smile by parsing each event object and returning 2xx response status codes.
4. Deploy your webhook endpoint so itâ€™s a publicly accessible HTTPS URL.
5. Register your publicly accessible webhook endpoint by making a request to the /webhooks endpoint. You will need to specify the:
   - URL: the webhook endpoint or URL.
   - Event types: the event types you want to monitor separated by commas (see below for the different event types), or simply use "ALL_EVENTS" to get notifications on all event types.
   - Active: whether you want this endpoint definition to be active or inactive (you can update this later via an update request)
   - Secret: a phrase or value that you can use to validate the authenticity of the payload by digesting the received payload body bnd y using HMAC-SHA512, with the secret as key

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> Below example shows a request using Shell script/cURL with the webhook receiving endpoint set as "https://webhook.clienturl.xyz"

``` curl
curl --request POST \
  --url https://sandbox.smileapi.io/v1/webhooks \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic amFuLnBhYmVsbG9uQHNtaWxlZmluYW5jaWFsLmFwcDpOZXRTdWl0ZTIwMTgh' \

![Signatures](https://img.icons8.com/ios/50/000000/signature.png)


## Validating Payloads
When events are sent from Smile, you might want to validate the authenticity of the webhook payload, to make sure it came from Smile. You can do that by using the signature, which is included in the headers of each payload. 

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> To validate the authenticy of the payload, you need to get the entirety of the payload body and digest it using HMAC-SHA512, with the "secret" you defined when you registered your endpoint as the key.

Below is example to check the validity of a payload using HMAC-SHA512:
- NodeJs
``` javascript
const http = require('http');
const crypto = require('crypto');
const serverPort = 80
const requestListener = function (req, res) {
  // the client secret is being configured when a webhook is created
  const client_secret = 'a little secret';
  var requestBody = '';
  req.on('readable', () => {
    var read = req.read()
    if(read != null) {
    requestBody += read;
    }
  });
  req.on('end', () => {
    jsonBody = JSON.stringify(requestBody);
    // do whatever you need with jsonBody, however use requestBody in the signature payload
    signature = crypto.createHmac('sha512',client_secret).update(requestBody).digest('hex');
  console.log('Signature:' + signature);
  res.writeHead(200);
  res.end(signature);
  })
}
const server = http.createServer(requestListener);
server.listen(serverPort);
```
- JAVA
``` Java
package com.smile.webhook;

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Objects;
import javax.crypto.Mac;
import javax.crypto.SecretKey;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Hex;

public class VerifySignatureUtil {

    public static boolean verifySignature(HttpServletRequest request) throws IOException {
        String data = getRequestBody(request);
        String secret = "<your secret>";
        String signature = request.getHeader("Smile-Signature");
        boolean result = Objects.equals(signature, generateSignature(secret, data));
        System.out.println("verify result:" + result);
        return result;
    }

    public static String getRequestBody(HttpServletRequest request) throws IOException {
        if (request.getMethod().equals("POST")) {
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

            try (BufferedReader bufferedReader = request.getReader()) {
                char[] charBuffer = new char[128];
                int bytesRead;
                while ((bytesRead = bufferedReader.read(charBuffer)) != -1) {
                    sb.append(charBuffer, 0, bytesRead);
                }
            }

            return sb.toString();
        }
        return "";
    }

    public static String generateSignature(String secret, String requestBody) {
        byte[] key= secret.getBytes();
        byte[] content= requestBody.getBytes();
        String signature = null;
        try {
            SecretKey secretKey = new SecretKeySpec(key, "HmacSHA512");
            Mac mac = Mac.getInstance("HmacSHA512");
            mac.init(secretKey);
            byte[] bytes = mac.doFinal(content);
            signature = Hex.encodeHexString(bytes);
        } catch (Exception var6) {
            throw new RuntimeException(var6);
        }
        System.out.println("signature=" + signature);
        return signature;
    }

}

```
If your digest matches the one that you received as the payload signature in the headers, then the payload is valid and authentic.

> ðŸš§ Warning
> 
> When you validate the payload, make sure you digest the entire payload. Do not include extra spaces before or after it. Do not pre-parse or reformat it before doing the validation check.
