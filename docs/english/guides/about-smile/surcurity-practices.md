Smile takes security seriously by using the highest security standards to protect users' information and privacy.

## Credential security

Smile passes all credentials to the data source's servers via TLS to initiate the process of information sharing. All data is encrypted at RSA 4096 with SHA-256 signing for maximum security.

## Personal data privacy

Users' personal data is provided on a revocation-based model: users can, at any point, revoke access to their data, making sure they are in full control when and to whom they share their own data. All information is deleted once they revoke access through our available Revoke API.

## Privacy Policy

We also maintain a [Privacy Policy](https://www.getsmileapi.com/privacy-policy) so you can be sure how your data is being used.
