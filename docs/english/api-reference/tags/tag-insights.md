The Smile Insights API provides common calculations for risk factors based on available data from [Users](/reference/users), such as income and employment data.

These Insights can help with decisioning processes whether assessing a candidate for financial services or employment pruposes. Common calculations such as averages, minimums, maximums, and others are done for you across a number of different durations or categories of information.

Insights are available for the following data sources:

| Data source | Insight category |
|---|---|
| Social security services | Identity, Employments, Incomes, Liabilities |
| Government employee insurance and pension agency | Identity, Employments, Incomes |
| National health insurance agency | Identity, Incomes |
| National housing provident fund | Identity, Employments, Incomes, Liabilities |

> ðŸ“˜ Note

> You may come across the following values when ingesting our insight data:
> 
> * -999 - the data is empty, missing, or not available from the data source
> * -998 - there was an error in computing the insight value


## Identity and Employments Insights

Identity and employment insights give you a quick summarized view of the User's information without needing to calculate this information from the raw data from the Data Source.

| Insight variable name | Description |

## Income Insights

Income insights give you a range of common calculations using the user's income records across different months (based on [Estimated Income](/reference/estimated-incomes)). This saves you the time and resources needed to calculate this information from the raw data from the Data Source.

> ðŸ“˜ Note

> For **My.SSS**, there may be a 1-2 month delay from when income-related data is posted from the data source. Smile takes this into account, but it is important to note this possible data discrepancy and add it to your own calculations.
