## Webhooks

Smile uses webhooks to notify your application in real time when an event happens in our servers that is related to your environment.

Event notifications can be sent when a new user is created, an account is successfully connected, an employment document is uploaded, an invitation is sent, or when new any new type data is added such as a user's identity, income, employment, and others. Check out the list of available events that you can subscribe to in *List of Events*, below. 

These webhooks are sent via a secure channel, using HTTPS from a static IP address, with the data being sent in JSON format. These also come with a signature for you to validate the authenticity of the payload. 

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> Our static IP address is **18.142.61.230**. You can whitelist this IP address in your back-end to ensure that your application receives event notifications coming from Smile.

Webhooks are particularly useful for getting notifications about asynchronous events, and either executing actions in your backend system when any of these events happen, or knowing when to refresh your front-end system to display any new data.


### Implementation Steps

You can start receiving event notifications in your application using the following steps:

1. Use our documentation and available resources to **identify the events you want to monitor** and the event payloads to parse.
2. **Create a webhook endpoint** as an HTTPS endpoint (URL) on your  server or application. 
3. **Test that your webhook endpoint is working properly.** Make sure that your server or application is able to handle requests from Smile by parsing each event object and returning ``2xx`` response status codes.
4. **Deploy your webhook endpoint** so it's a publicly accessible HTTPS URL.
5. **Register your publicly accessible webhook endpoint** using one of the two methods below.

#### Webhook Registration via Developer Portal

You may register your webhooks easily using the [Developer Portal](https://portal.getsmileapi.com?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=internal_link). After logging in, navigate to [the **Webhooks** section](https://portal.getsmileapi.com/webhooks?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=internal_link) and click on the **Add New Webhook** button to add your new webhook.

![portal-webhooks.png](../../../../assets/images/portal-webhooks.png)

Provide the following details:

- **Name**: Name to easily identify the webhook. Only displayed in the Developer Portal.
- **URL**: the webhook endpoint or URL.
- **Secret**: a phrase or value that you can use to validate the authenticity of the payload by digesting the received payload body using HMAC-SHA512, with the secret as the key. See *Validating Payloads*, below.
- **Include Payload**: Set to *True* or *False* depending on if you wish to include the full data payload related to the endpoint affected by the event. Defaults to false. Payload size may vary. Only for `TASK_FINISHED` and `ACCOUNT_SYNC_TASK_FINISHED` events.
- **Events**: the event types you want to monitor. You may monitor all events or specific events by selecting them manually in the select area.

#### Webhook Registration via API

Alternatively, you may make a [POST request to the ``/webhooks`` endpoint](/reference/create-webhook) to register your webhook. You will need to specify the following:

- **URL**: the webhook endpoint or URL.
- **Event types**: the event types you want to monitor, separated by commas (see below for the different event types), or simply use ``ALL_EVENTS`` to get notifications on all event types.
- **Active**: must be set to True or the Webhook will not take effect
- **Secret**: a phrase or value that you can use to validate the authenticity of the payload by digesting the received payload body using HMAC-SHA512, with the secret as the key. See *Validating Payloads*, below.
- **Include Payload**: `TRUE` or `FALSE` depending on if you wish to include the full data payload related to the endpoint affected by the event. Defaults to false. Payload size may vary. Only for `TASK_FINISHED` and `ACCOUNT_SYNC_TASK_FINISHED` events.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> Below example shows a request using Shell script/cURL with the webhook receiving endpoint set as ``https://webhook.clienturl.xyz``
> 
> ``` curl
> curl --request POST \
>   --url https://sandbox.smileapi.io/v1/webhooks \
>   --header 'Authorization: Basic amFuLnBhYmVsbG9uQHNtaWxlZmluYW5jaWFsLmFwcDpOZXRTdWl0ZTIwMTgh' \
>   --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
>   --data '{
>   "name": "Event Notification Postback",
>   "url": "https://webhook.clienturl.xyz",
>   "eventTypes": [
>     "ACCOUNT_CONNECTED",
>     "IDENTITY_ADDED"
>   ],
>   "active": true,
>   "secret": "a little secret",
>   "includePayload": false
> }'
> ```

### Including the Data Payload

For the `TASK_FINISHED` and `ACCOUNT_SYNC_TASK_FINISHED` events, you may opt to include the data payload when you are notified of the event. This will allow you to skip a manual API query to the related endpoint after receiving the notification, but still obtain the data related to the event.

For example, if a new user has connected an account, you may opt to obtain their full data through the webhook, saving you an API call to obtain the data. However, note that this data payload may be large in size.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> If the datapoint is list data (for example, Contributions, Estimated Incomes, etc.), the data payload will return a maximum of 300 items. If the Account has more than 300 items, please query the other items separately via the related endpoint.

### Webhook Retries

To ensure you receive the notification, Smile operates on an "at least once" delivery guarantee.

Smile checks for an HTTP response with status code between 200 and 299 from your endpoint when we send the webhook. In the event that we receive a response outside of 200 - 299, Smile will attempt to resend the webhook up to two times with a few dozen seconds between each retry.

This means that you may receive the same webhook event more than once. Please ensure you process these possible duplicate notifications in your endpoint or application. You can detect duplicate webhook events by comparing the ``id`` value to previous events (see *Example Payloads*, below).

![Signatures](https://img.icons8.com/ios/50/000000/signature.png)


## Validating Payloads

When events are sent from Smile, you might want to validate the authenticity of the webhook payload, to make sure it came from Smile. You can do that by using the signature, which is included in the headers of each payload. 

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> To validate the authenticity of the payload, you need to get the entirety of the payload body and digest it using HMAC-SHA512, with the "secret" you defined when you registered your endpoint as the key.

Below is example to check the validity of a payload using HMAC-SHA512:

- NodeJs
    ``` javascript
    const http = require('http');
    const crypto = require('crypto');
    const serverPort = 80
    const requestListener = function (req, res) {
      // the client secret is being configured when a webhook is created
      const client_secret = 'a little secret';
      var requestBody = '';
      req.on('readable', () => {
        var read = req.read()
        if(read != null) {
        requestBody += read;
        }
      });
      req.on('end', () => {
        jsonBody = JSON.stringify(requestBody);
        // do whatever you need with jsonBody, however use requestBody in the signature payload
        signature = crypto.createHmac('sha512',client_secret).update(requestBody).digest('hex');
      console.log('Signature:' + signature);
      res.writeHead(200);
      res.end(signature);
      })
    }
    const server = http.createServer(requestListener);
    server.listen(serverPort);
    ```
- JAVA
    ``` Java
    package com.smile.webhook;
    
    import java.io.BufferedReader;
    import java.io.IOException;
    import java.util.Objects;
    import javax.crypto.Mac;
    import javax.crypto.SecretKey;
    import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;
    import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
    import org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Hex;
    
    public class VerifySignatureUtil {
    
        public static boolean verifySignature(HttpServletRequest request) throws IOException {
            String data = getRequestBody(request);
            String secret = "<your secret>";
            String signature = request.getHeader("Smile-Signature");
            boolean result = Objects.equals(signature, generateSignature(secret, data));
            System.out.println("verify result:" + result);
            return result;
        }
    
        private static String getRequestBody(HttpServletRequest request) throws IOException {
            if (request.getMethod().equals("POST")) {
                StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    
                try (BufferedReader bufferedReader = request.getReader()) {
                    char[] charBuffer = new char[128];
                    int bytesRead;
                    while ((bytesRead = bufferedReader.read(charBuffer)) != -1) {
                        sb.append(charBuffer, 0, bytesRead);
                    }
                }
    
                return sb.toString();
            }
            return "";
        }
    
        private static String generateSignature(String secret, String requestBody) {
            byte[] key= secret.getBytes();
            byte[] content= requestBody.getBytes();
            String signature = null;
            try {
                SecretKey secretKey = new SecretKeySpec(key, "HmacSHA512");
                Mac mac = Mac.getInstance("HmacSHA512");
                mac.init(secretKey);
                byte[] bytes = mac.doFinal(content);
                signature = Hex.encodeHexString(bytes);
            } catch (Exception var6) {
                throw new RuntimeException(var6);
            }
            System.out.println("signature=" + signature);
            return signature;
        }
    
    }
    ```

If your digest matches the one that you received as the payload signature in the headers, then the payload is valid and authentic.

> ðŸš§ Warning
> 
> When you validate the payload, make sure you digest the entire payload. Do not include extra spaces before or after it. Do not pre-parse or reformat it before doing the validation check.
