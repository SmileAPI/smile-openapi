# Authentication

Basic authentication is a simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol. To use it, send your HTTP requests with an Authorization header that contains the word `Basic` followed by a space and a base64-encoded string `API Key:API Secret`.

> 📘 Example
>
> `Authorization: Basic ZGVtbzpwQDU1dzByZA==`

**Your API Key and Secret can be found by logging into the [Developer Portal](https://portal.getsmileapi.com/) under the *API Keys* section.**

Upon signup, you will have instant and free access to test on our Sandbox environment. If you need Production environment access, [contact us](https://www.getsmileapi.com/contact-us).
